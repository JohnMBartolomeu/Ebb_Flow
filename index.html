<p>From reading this article it brings many things to light and different opinions that a lot of people have an opposition for. Paper, paint, graphite medias being considered archaic is something artists and people who are not artistically driven, can be seen as a falsehood. To most people pen and paper is going to stand the test of time as a major form of communication; I myself have thought the same thing until recent events.</p>

<p>This article presents the question of whether or not the web or even the typed form will surpass and continue on in papers place. Should we embrace it, or should we be weary of it. The latter of the two options is a ridiculous thought; we should embrace the digital age of communication and designing. There are many ways for creative minds to share information or create art through different apps such as Photoshop, Illustrator or inDesign that anything in the modern age is possible. While writing physical copies of things and creating can be an excellent medium, the digital age will go from golden age to golden age, and will always be here forever more.</p>

<p>The article is both informative and has good symbolism and comparisons to the Eastern philosophies showing that progress should not be stopped nor ignored; while also talking about the origins of the media and how the technological age becomes more and more prevalent in people's lives. Very informative article and really pushes the ideas of change in forms of communication while using the old methods as examples.</p>
